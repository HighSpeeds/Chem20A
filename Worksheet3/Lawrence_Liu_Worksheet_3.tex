\section*{Problem 1}
We have that
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}$$
Thus we have that
$$v=\frac{m\lambda}=3 095 274 m/s$$
And thus we have that the electron kenetic energy is
$$E=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\boxed{4.363\cdot 10^{-18}J}$$
\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{(a)}
We have from the heisenberg uncertainty principle that
$$\Delta x\Delta p\geq\frac{\hbar}{2}$$
Thus we have that
$$m_e\Delta x\Delta v\geq\frac{\hbar}{2}$$
Thus we have that
$$\Delta v\geq\frac{\hbar}{2m_e\Delta x}=\boxed{57 883m/s}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
We have that we can also rewrite the result from part (a) as 
$$\Delta v\geq\frac{h}{4\pi m_e\Delta x}$$
So in our case of $h=1js$ we would have that 
$$\Delta v\geq\frac{1}{4\pi m_e\Delta x}=8.735\cdot 10^{37}m/s$$
\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{(a)}
For a electron in a box we have that the energy is given by 
$$E_n=\frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2m_eL^2}$$
Therefore we have that the ground state is
$$E_1=\frac{\pi^2\hbar^2}{2m_eL^2}=3.355 \cdot 10^{-18}J$$
And the first excited state is
$$E_2=\frac{4\pi^2\hbar^2}{2m_eL^2}=1.342 \cdot 10^{-17}J$$
Thus we have that the minimum energy required to excite the electron is
$$\Delta E=E_2-E_1=\boxed{1.007 \cdot 10^{-17}J}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
We have that the wavefunction for the ground state is 
$$\psi_1(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\cos(\frac{\pi x}{L})$$
Therefore the probability $P_1$ of finding the box inside the interval $[0.5,0.7]$ angstrom is given by
$$P_1=\int_{0.5}^{0.7}|\psi_1(x)|^2dx=\boxed{\frac{2}{1.34\AA}\int_{0.5\AA}^{0.7\AA}\cos^2\left(\frac{\pi x}{1.34\AA}\right)dx}$$
Likewise we have that the wavefunction for the first excited state is
$$\psi_2(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin(\frac{2\pi x}{L})$$
Therefore the probability $P_2$ of finding the box inside the interval $[0.5,0.7]$ angstrom is given by
$$P_2=\int_{0.5}^{0.7}|\psi_2(x)|^2dx=\boxed{\frac{2}{1.34\AA}\int_{0.5\AA}^{0.7\AA}\sin^2\left(\frac{2\pi x}{1.34\AA}\right)dx}$$
